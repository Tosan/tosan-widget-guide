### ssoJwt
the 'ssoJwt' parameter is a JWT(JSON Web Tokens).
      
for example:
>     
      
       eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJqdGkiOiJlNDBmY2VkYy0zNmYyLTQxOTYtOTc2Yi1mMWUxY2NhOWQwY2YiLCJiYW5rQ29kZSI6IkJPSU1JUiIsInNzb1Rva2VuRXhwaXJhdGlvblRpbWUiOjE1ODA3MTMxNTcyODUsImxhbmd1YWdlIjoiZmEiLCJzc29Ub2tlbiI6IjM5YmZjNDA2LWZiMDgtNDk1Zi05MTNjLTUyMWM4MTFlNTRhNCIsImV4cCI6MTU4MDcxMzQ1NX0.
       
this token must be encoded by the widget and its payload contains the below information:

```json
   {
      "jti": "e40fcedc-36f2-4196-976b-f1e1cca9d0cf",
      "bankCode": "BOIMIR",
